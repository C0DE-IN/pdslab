            "Nanozymes are the nanomaterials which mimic the enzyme characteristics. These are the trending materials with very high stability and efficiency in catalyzing important metabolic processes in-vitro and in-vivo. Compared to natural enzymes, Nanozymes are less expensive, easy to manufacture and can be stored for longer time. Despite the potential application of bare nanoparticles, we hypothesize that improved surface functionalization of nanoparticles with active entities could enhance specific targeting and cellular uptake with tuneable coronas.",

            "Mitochondria are essential dynamic organelles required for several vital cellular functions ranging from providing cellular energy to regulating cell death. Therefore, proper mitochondrial biogenesis is critical for cell survival. Mitochondrial biogenesis requires accurate and efficient transport of numerous mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol to their destined mitochondrial compartments. This import is mediated by dedicated protein machinery present in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Among them, the carrier translocase, also called as TIM22 complex facilitates the insertion of the complex polytopic inner membrane (IM) proteins having internal hydrophobic targeting signals. Mutations in different subunits of carrier translocase are associated with a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases and cell death. However, the pathomechanism of carrier translocase contributing to disease progression is still an open question.",
            "I am interested in understanding the molecular mechanism involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial genome integrity and overall mitochondrial health by TIM22 complex. My further focus is on elucidating the role of TIM22 complex beyond its translocation function by identifying the novel substrate proteins or interactors in mediating cellular health."],
